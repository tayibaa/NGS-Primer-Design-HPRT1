In-silico design and specificity analysis of PCR primers for the human HPRT1 gene using NCBI Primer-BLAST as part of an NGS practical assignment.
# Primer Design and Specificity Analysis of Human HPRT1 Gene

## Overview
This repository documents the in-silico design and specificity analysis of PCR primers for the human HPRT1 gene. This work was carried out as part of an academic practical module on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to understand primer design parameters and target specificity.

Primer specificity was evaluated using NCBI Primer-BLAST against the human reference genome.
